  abstract = {Photoacoustic (PA) imaging, also called optoacoustic imaging, is a new biomedical imaging modality based on the use of laser-generated ultrasound that has emerged over the last decade. It is a hybrid modality, combining the high-contrast and spectroscopic-based specificity of optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. In essence, a PA image can be regarded as an ultrasound image in which the contrast depends not on the mechanical and elastic properties of the tissue, but its optical properties, specifically optical absorption. As a consequence, it offers greater specificity than conventional ultrasound imaging with the ability to detect haemoglobin, lipids, water and other light-absorbing chomophores, but with greater penetration depth than purely optical imaging modalities that rely on ballistic photons. As well as visualizing anatomical structures such as the microvasculature, it can also provide functional information in the form of blood oxygenation, blood flow and temperature. All of this can be achieved over a wide range of length scales from micrometres to centimetres with scalable spatial resolution. These attributes lend PA imaging to a wide variety of applications in clinical medicine, preclinical research and basic biology for studying cancer, cardiovascular disease, abnormalities of the microcirculation and other conditions. With the emergence of a variety of truly compelling in vivo images obtained by a number of groups around the world in the last 2-3 years, the technique has come of age and the promise of PA imaging is now beginning to be realized. Recent highlights include the demonstration of whole-body small-animal imaging, the first demonstrations of molecular imaging, the introduction of new microscopy modes and the first steps towards clinical breast imaging being taken as well as a myriad of in vivo preclinical imaging studies. In this article, the underlying physical principles of the technique, its practical implementation, and a range of clinical and preclinical applications are reviewed.},

  abstract = {The tumour microenvironment (TME) is a complex cellular ecosystem subjected to chemical and physical signals that play a role in shaping tumour heterogeneity, invasion and metastasis. Studying the roles of the TME in cancer progression would strongly benefit from non-invasive visualisation of the tumour as a whole organ in vivo , both preclinically in mouse models of the disease, as well as in patient tumours. Although imaging techniques exist that can probe different facets of the TME, they face several limitations, including limited spatial resolution, extended scan times and poor specificity from confounding signals. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality, currently in clinical trials, that has the potential to overcome these limitations. Here, we review the biological properties of the TME and potential of existing imaging methods that have been developed to analyse these properties non-invasively. We then introduce PAI and explore the preclinical and clinical evidence that support its use in probing multiple features of the TME simultaneously, including blood vessel architecture, blood oxygenation, acidity, extracellular matrix deposition, lipid concentration and immune cell infiltration. Finally, we highlight the future prospects and outstanding challenges in the application of PAI as a tool in cancer research and as part of a clinical oncologist's arsenal.},

  abstract = {The ability of photoacoustic imaging to measure functional tissue properties, such as blood oxygenation sO2, enables a wide variety of possible applications. sO2 can be computed from the ratio of oxyhemoglobin HbO2 and deoxyhemoglobin Hb, which can be distuinguished by multispectral photoacoustic imaging due to their distinct wavelength-dependent absorption. However, current methods for estimating sO2 yield inaccurate results in realistic settings, due to the unknown and wavelength-dependent influence of the light fluence on the signal. In this work, we propose learned spectral decoloring to enable blood oxygenation measurements to be inferred from multispectral photoacoustic imaging. The method computes sO2 pixel-wise, directly from initial pressure spectra Sp0({$\lambda$},x), which represent initial pressure values at a fixed spatial location x over all recorded wavelengths {$\lambda$}. The method is compared to linear unmixing approaches, as well as pO2 and blood gas analysis reference measurements. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is able to obtain sO2 estimates from multispectral photoacoustic measurements in silico, in vitro, and in vivo.},

  abstract = {Significance: Optical and acoustic imaging techniques enable noninvasive visualisation of structural and functional properties of tissue. The quantification of measurements, however, remains challenging due to the inverse problems that must be solved. Emerging data-driven approaches are promising, but they rely heavily on the presence of high-quality simulations across a range of wavelengths due to the lack of ground truth knowledge of tissue acoustical and optical properties in realistic settings. Aim: To facilitate this process, we present the open-source simulation and image processing for photonics and acoustics (SIMPA) Python toolkit. SIMPA is being developed according to modern software design standards. Approach: SIMPA enables the use of computational forward models, data processing algorithms, and digital device twins to simulate realistic images within a single pipeline. SIMPA's module implementations can be seamlessly exchanged as SIMPA abstracts from the concrete implementation of each forward model and builds the simulation pipeline in a modular fashion. Furthermore, SIMPA provides comprehensive libraries of biological structures, such as vessels, as well as optical and acoustic properties and other functionalities for the generation of realistic tissue models. Results: To showcase the capabilities of SIMPA, we show examples in the context of photoacoustic imaging: the diversity of creatable tissue models, the customisability of a simulation pipeline, and the degree of realism of the simulations. Conclusions: SIMPA is an open-source toolkit that can be used to simulate optical and acoustic imaging modalities. The code is available at: https://github.com/IMSY-DKFZ/simpa, and all of the examples and experiments in this paper can be reproduced using the code available at: https://github.com/IMSY-DKFZ/simpa\_paper\_experiments.},

Aim: A method for accurate and applicable real-time quantification of local sO2 with OA imaging. Approach: We combine multiple illumination (MI) sensing with learned spectral decoloring (LSD). We train LSD feedforward neural networks and random forests on Monte Carlo simulations of spectrally colored absorbed energy spectra, to apply the trained models to real OA measurements. We validate our combined MI-LSD method on a highly reliable, reproducible, and easily scalable phantom model, based on copper and nickel sulfate solutions. Results: With this sulfate model, we see a consistently high estimation accuracy using MI-LSD, with median absolute estimation errors of 2.5 to 4.5 percentage points. We further find fewer outliers in MI-LSD estimates compared with LSD. Random forest regressors outperform previously reported neural network approaches. Conclusions: Random forest-based MI-LSD is a promising method for accurate quantitative OA oximetry imaging.},

With the availability of commercial instruments, the acquisition of data using this modality has become consistent and standardized. However, the analysis of such data is often hampered by opaque processing algorithms, which are challenging to verify and validate from a user perspective. Furthermore, such tools are inflexible, often locking users into a restricted set of processing motifs, which may not be able to accommodate the demands of diverse experiments. To address these needs, we have developed a Reconstruction, Analysis, and Filtering Toolbox to support the analysis of photoacoustic imaging data. The toolbox includes several algorithms to improve the overall quantification of photoacoustic imaging, including non-negative constraints and multispectral filters. We demonstrate various use cases, including dynamic imaging challenges and quantification of drug effect, and describe the ability of the toolbox to be parallelized on a high performance computing cluster.},

  abstract = {Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has become a fast-evolving biomedical imaging modality in recent years. In PAT, image reconstruction is a critical step to produce high-quality photoacoustic images from raw photoacoustic signals. To date, algorithms based on back projection are the most widely used image reconstruction techniques due to their simplicity and computational efficiency. However, images reconstructed by back projection contain negative values, especially at the edge of photoacoustic sources, which have no physical meaning and are essentially undesired artifacts. In this work, we study the formation mechanism, fundamental causes and removal strategies of the negativity artifacts in back-projection-based PAT. Our results show that limited detector bandwidth and limited view angle are two fundamental causes of negativity artifacts. When the bandwidth of a detector is limited, back-projection signals will be distorted as a result of the loss of frequency contents and negativity artifacts thus appear. When the view angle of the detector is limited, photoacoustic signals propagating in three-dimensional space will be partially lost, resulting in negativity artifacts. Post-processing strategies, such as envelope detection and forced zeroing can be used to remove the negativity artifacts but may cause problems. Since negativity artifacts are a common image quality degradation factor in PAT, understanding their characteristics may expedite the development of novel artifact-removal techniques and artifact-free image reconstruction algorithms, which are of importance to correct image interpretation and quantitative imaging.},

Current clinically approved imaging modalities suffer long procedure times and limited spatiotemporal resolution. Optoacoustic tomography (OT) is an emerging clinical imaging modality that may overcome these challenges. By acquiring data at multiple wavelengths,OTcan interrogate hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation directly and resolve contributions from injected contrast agents. In this study, we tested whether two dynamic OT techniques, oxygen-enhanced (OE) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-OT, could provide surrogate biomarkers of tumor vascular function, hypoxia, and necrosis. We found that vascular maturity led to changes in vascular function that affected tumor perfusion, modulating the DCE-OT signal. Perfusion in turn regulated oxygen availability, driving the OE-OT signal. In particular, we demonstrate for the first time a strong per-tumor and spatial correlation between imaging biomarkers derived from these in vivo techniques and tumor hypoxia quantified ex vivo. Our findings indicate that OT may offer a significant advantage for localized imaging of tumor response to vascular-targeted therapies when compared with existing clinical DCE methods.},

Different implementations of PAT allow the spatial resolution to be scaled with the desired imaging depth in tissue while a high depth-to-resolution ratio is maintained. As a rule of thumb, the achievable spatial resolution is on the order of 1/200 of the desired imaging depth, which can reach up to 7 centimeters.
