====================
Get Involved
====================

We'd love to get more people involved with PATATO
to add additional features and make it better. Feel free
to take a look at the list of issues on our GitHub repository
or fork the repository and make your own updates.

* Please add tests for any new features.
* Please follow the existing coding style.

If you'd like to help out or for more information,
please contact Thomas Else at thomas.else@cruk.cam.ac.uk.
